# Mini Challenge 2

## Overriding templates

### Acceptance Criteria

0. Add the following line to `config/settings.py`: `EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"`

1. Generate a template for your sign up view such that users can leverage it to create new accounts (and then login).

2. Test the password reset feature then:

2.1. Generate the following templates for the built-in password reset feature:

2.1.1. password_reset_form.html - this form allows us to submit an email address to receive password reset instructions

2.1.2. password_reset_done.html - this template simply confirms the successfull submittal of the previous form

2.1.3. password_reset_confirm.html - this *form* allows us to set a new password

2.1.4. password_reset_complete.html - this template simply confirms that we successfully set a new password

3. Add anchor tags on your base template (or wherever you see fit) to ensure users can access the new features you've added.

# Note

You do not have to override the email templates but if you want to:

the subject name is `registration/password_email_subject.txt`

and the email body is `registration/password_reset_email.html`
